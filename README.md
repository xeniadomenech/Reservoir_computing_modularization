# Reservoir_computing_modularization

The aim of the project is to build a modularized Reservoir Computing model capable of identifying different movement related states from a neural data set recorded from a non-human primate. This code is based on the program of Arnau Naval Ruiz ([Arnau's codes](https://github.com/ArnauNaval/TFG_ReservoirComputing)).

## Files description

* data.py : Contains all the code regarding the data structures used and data processing.

* network.py : Contains the structure of the network and all the processes applied to it.

* reservoir.py : Contains the structure of the reservoir and the methods to train and test it.

* main.py : Runs the project, it builds the reservoir, the network and the data, using the mentioned files above.

Note: the data files need to be in the same directory as the python files mentioned above.
